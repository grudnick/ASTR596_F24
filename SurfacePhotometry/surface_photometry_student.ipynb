    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be performing surface photometry of four nearby galaxies, including ellipticals and spirals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will be done via a mixture of python commands using the photutils aperture photometry package (https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/aperture.html) and the photutils isophote fitting package (https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/isophote.html).  We will also be using imexam and ds9.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn how to do the following things:\n",
    "* estimate the background for an image and subtract it;\n",
    "* estimate initial guesses for input parameters to an isophotal fitting code using ds9;\n",
    "* fit elliptical isophotes;\n",
    "* use photometry within these isophotes to measure the radial profile of various parameters;\n",
    "* compute the radius within which half the total light is contained.  This is called the effective radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Note: Enter in all code to the problems in the provided notebook cells. Questions to answer will be <b>bolded</b>.</i>  \n",
    "\n",
    "All your answers should be entered in this notebook. Each student will need to hand in their own notebook by uploading it to GitHub following the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code places where you will need to put something or write your own code are specified by `#***************`  You will not get points for doing this unless explicitly noted.  Some of these things are just to make sure you are setting up your paths correctly.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem we will measure the half-light (or effective) radius of every galaxy.  To do this we will first create something called a \"curve of growth\", which shows how much light you get within each aperture.  As you increase in radius this cumulative flux grows.  We will also plot a surface brightness profile, which is the average surface brightness in each annulus.  We will use the annuli that have fixed ellipse geometries from above.\n",

    "For the purpose of these plots, we will use the ellipse centers, ellipticity, and position angle that we determined as the median of all the ellipses in the previous exercise.\n",

    "* measure the total flux in each elliptical aperture\n",

    "* measure mean surface brightness in mag/asec^2 in each annulus\n",

    "* plot the surface brightness profile\n",
    "* determine the surface brightness at the center and at the half-light radius and compare them.\n",
