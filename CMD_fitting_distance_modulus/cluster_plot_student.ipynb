    "This exercise is intended to give you a practical exercise in determining the distance to star clusters in the milky way.  You will do this by plotting the color-magnitude diagrams of 4 clusters compared to that of a cluster with a known distances.  This \"reference\" cluster is the nearby Pleiades (M 45), which is visible to the naked eye in late fall/winter.  It has a distance of 130pc.\n",
